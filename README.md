# Giphy Search

Find your next favorite GIF... the cool way

## How to use the app

- The home page provides 3 random trending GIFs.
- Use the search bar to access the entire Giphy library of GIFs, almost anything you can imagine is there (first prompt recommendation: 'the office chili')
- The app renders your searches out as .mp4 files, which is a video file
- You can left-click to copy the GIF url to your clipboard to share with your friends
- Alternatively, if you click navigate to /gifs (you can click the word "Gifs" above the search bar) they will be rendered as .gif files instead
- From there, you can right-click an image and select "Copy image" then paste the image directly into Teams, Slack, or wherever you are trying to share
